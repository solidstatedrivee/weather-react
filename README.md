## Summary

Currently keeping myself busy with a weather app that is mainly to be viewed on mobile (I should do the responsible thing and make it responsive). I love working with API's because you get all kinds of dynamic data that you can use to render dynamic components, which is obviously great for apps. However this is a project that allows me to get more familiar with React and creating SPA's. This is is just an initial commit and i will revise the design, UX, and add much more weather info. Happy coding ðŸ¤“!
